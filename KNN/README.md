# K-Nearest Neighbhors
K-nearest neighbor algorithm is a majority vote between the K most similar (close) instances to a given “unseen” observation.

## Application
Given a dataset of features that classfies the data as a digit between 0-9, implementing a classification model using KNN Algorithm to classify unseen data.

Script will also test the model on different variations of the dataset and plot the results to view analysis.

## Usage
