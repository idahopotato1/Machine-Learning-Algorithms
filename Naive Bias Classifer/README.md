# Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. In machine learning, Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

## Application 
Based on three discrete features, using the Niave Bayes Classifier, model is able to determine whether a consumer is likely to purchase a product or not.
