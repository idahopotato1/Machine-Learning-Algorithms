# K-Means 
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. 

## Application
Given a dataset of features that classfies the data as a digit between 0-9, implementing a classification model using K-Means Algorithm to classify unseen data.

## Usage
python3 KMeans.py [file_name] [k] [ **optional** centriods] [ **optional** iter_count]

[file_name]: input file

[k]: number of clusters to create

[ **optional** centriods]: intital means of centriods

[ **optional** iter_count]: number of iterations to training the model
